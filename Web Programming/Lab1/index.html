      <h2>General Presetation</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          George Walker Bush (born July 6, 1946) is an American politician and businessman who served
          as the 43rd president of the United States from 2001 to 2009. A member of the Republican Party, he had
          previously served as the 46th governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000. Bush is frequently referred to
          as George W. Bush, Bush Junior, or Bush 43 to distinguish him from his father, George H. W. Bush,
          who served as the 41st president of the United States from 1989 to 1993.

        <p>
          Bush is the eldest son of Barbara and George H. W. Bush, and the second son to become the American
          president after his father, the first being John Quincy Adams. After graduating from Yale University
          in 1968 and Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in the oil industry. Bush married Laura Welch
          in 1977 and unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives shortly thereafter.
          He later co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before defeating Ann Richards in the 1994
          Texas gubernatorial election. Bush was elected president of the United States in 2000 when he defeated
          Democratic incumbent Vice President Al Gore after a narrow and contested win that involved a Supreme Court
          decision to stop a recount in Florida. He became the fourth person to be elected president while receiving fewer popular votes than his opponent.

        <h2>Foreign policy</h2>
        <p>
          During his presidential campaign, Bush's foreign policy platform included
          support for stronger economic and political relationship with Latin America,
          especially Mexico, and a reduction of involvement in "nation-building" and other small-scale military engagements.
          The administration pursued a national missile defense. Bush was an advocate of China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
          After the September 11 attacks on New York, Bush launched the War on Terror, in which the United States military and a small
          international coalition invaded Afghanistan. In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush referred to an "axis of evil" consisting of Iraq,
          Iran and North Korea. In 2003, Bush then launched the invasion of Iraq, searching for weapons of mass destruction, which he described
          as being part of the War on Terrorism. Those invasions led to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the removal
          of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. Foreign Minister of India Pranab Mukherjee with President Bush, March 2008
          Bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations. He appointed
          long-time adviser Karen Hughes to oversee a global public relations campaign. Bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine.
          In March 2006, Bush reversed decades of U.S. policy when he visited the Republic of India in a trip focused particularly on areas of
          nuclear energy, counter-terrorism co-operation; and discussions that would eventually lead to the India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement.
          This was in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor, Bill Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the
          1998 nuclear tests has been characterized as "sanctions and hectoring".
          Midway through Bush's second term, questions arose whether Bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda,
          which was highlighted in policy changes toward some oil-rich former Soviet republics in central Asia.
          In an address before both Houses of Congress on September 20, 2001, Bush thanked the nations of the world for their support
          following the September 11 attacks. He specifically thanked UK Prime Minister Tony Blair for traveling to Washington to show
          "unity of purpose with America", and said "America has no truer friend than Great Britain."

            <h3>September 11 Attacks</h3>
            The September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush's presidency.
            That evening, he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, promising a strong response to the attacks.
            He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims. Three days after the attacks,
            Bush visited Ground Zero and met with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, firefighters, police officers, and volunteers.
            To much applause, Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing in a heap of rubble: "I can hear you.
            The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon."
